# Online-Election-System

The word “vote” means to choose from a list, to elect or to determine. The main goal of voting (in a scenario involving the citizens of a given country) is to come up with leaders of the people’s choice. Most countries, India not an exception, have problems when it comes to voting. Some of the problems involved include ridging votes during election, insecure or inaccessible polling stations, inadequate polling materials and also inexperienced personnel. In a manual system, sometimes people are registered in more than one area and can thus cast the vote multiple times. By creating an online database covering the country it will be possible to eliminate the double casting of votes. In some areas, officials of the Election Commission themselves cast votes and after the end of election they adjust these votes from the voter’s list. Hence, they manipulate the result of the election. There is clearly a need for a system that could reduce the authority of officials and could sustain the true nature of voting. It would also give people options to cast an empty vote if they don’t like to give the vote to any of the candidates. This online voting/polling system seeks to address the above issues. It should be noted that with this system in place, the users, citizens in this case shall be given ample time during the voting period. They shall also be trained on how to vote online before the election time.
